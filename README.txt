A direct transation of code from "Spectral Methods in Matlab"(SPMM) by L.N.Trefethen into python code. For the
moment codes are written so that each .py file corresponds to a chapter 
of SPMM. At the beginning of each code the variable "program_number" determines
which program will be run by the code. For example, setting Program_number = 40 
in the program "chapter_fourteen.py" runs program forty from chapter fourteen
of "SPMM". 
 
Unless stated otherwise, the code presented here were originally written in
Matlab and retrieved from:

Trefethen, Lloyd N. Spectral methods in MATLAB. Vol. 10. Siam, 2000.
