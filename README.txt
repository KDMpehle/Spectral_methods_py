Spectral_methods_py is my hobby project to directly translate code from 
"Spectral Methods in Matlab"(SPMM) by L.N.Trefethen into python code. For the
moment codes are written so that each .py file corresponds to a chapter 
of SPMM. At the beginning of each code the variable "program_number" determines
which program will be run by the code. For example, setting Program_number = 40 
in the program "chapter_fourteen.py" runs program forty from chapter fourteen
of "SPMM". 

The aim is to: (i) give the author familiarity with spectral 
collocation; (ii) Use this exercise as a basis for the numerical solution 
of other applied mathematics problems the author may encounter in future;
(iii) Provide the code from SPMM in a python,for others who desire
them in this language.
 
Unless stated otherwise, the code presented here were originally written in
Matlab and retrieved from:

Trefethen, Lloyd N. Spectral methods in MATLAB. Vol. 10. Siam, 2000.
